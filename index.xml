      <description>ðŸ‘‹! I am Thor, a Computer Science and Multimedia Engineer focused on Web Development. I am currently based in Barcelona, even though I spent some time living in Canada, Vancouver.
I have trouble naming my hobbies because Iâ€™m lucky enough that my biggest passion is what I do every day: coding. That said, I also enjoy reading (about code, obviously), traveling, taking pictures and learning about home automation.
Still want to get to know me better?</description>
